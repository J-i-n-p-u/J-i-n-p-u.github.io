    Worked as a research assistant advised by Pooja Jain (V.P. Strategic Innovation in WSP) and [Dr. Martin Fischer](https://profiles.stanford.edu/martin-fischer) (Professor at Stanford).

    This is a significant exploration of developing the practical workflow of a vision-based automatic pavement distress detection system and software kit, and I am also responsible for discovering the potential business value of the process. <br><br>

2.  **Pilot Air Quality Analysis in the Bay Area** (Mar 2022 - Now)\

    Key Words: Data Manipulation, Time Series Decomposition, Clustering, Regressive Analysis, Community-engaged     [*(R, MATLAB)*]{style="color:green"}

    ![](images/air.png){align="left" margin="50" width="230"} Worked as a research assistant advised by [Derek Ouyang](https://derekouyang.com/) (Research Manager at the [RegLab, Stanford](https://reglab.stanford.edu/)) and [Dr. Gabrielle Wong-Parodi](https://profiles.stanford.edu/209361) (Professor at Stanford).

    This community-engaged pilot study aims to improve adaptation to wildfire smoke and extreme heat in vulnerable communities. I am responsible for characterizing these communities' air quality and exploring their human-induced and environment-induced influence on it. Our team characterized the relationship between indoor and outdoor air quality with a spike lag model and verified it by actual monitoring data, which will be a vital contribution to our new journal paper.

    ![](images/battery.png){align="left" margin="50" width="200"} Accurately predicting the remaining useful lifetime of batteries is critical for accelerating technological development and creating a paradigm shift in battery usage. Data-driven approaches,based on large datasets, provide a physical-model agnostic way to predict the health status of batteries with high accuracy. However, most datadriven methods on battery life prediction often rely on features extracted from a hundred cycles worth of data for a given cell, making it computationally inefficient and incompatible with on-board application.

    The course project (CS 329P [Practical Machine Learning](https://c.d2l.ai/stanford-cs329p/)) applied machine-learning models, including linear regression, random forest regression, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks to make predictions on cell life. Our best model achieve a 7.5% prediction error given the data of only 5 cycles.
