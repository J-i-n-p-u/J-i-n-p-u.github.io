    This community-engaged pilot study aims to improve adaptation to wildfire smoke and extreme heat in vulnerable communities. I am responsible for characterizing these communities' air quality and exploring their human-induced and environment-induced influence. Our team characterized the relationship between indoor and outdoor air quality with a "spike lag" model and verified it with actual monitoring data.

    Key Words: Life Cycle Assessment, Sensitivity Analysis     [*(R, [SimaPro](https://simapro.com/))*]{style="color:green"}

    ![](images/lca.png){align="left" margin="50" width="300"} Fortuna Cools ([Fortuna](https://www.fortunacools.com/)) was founded in 2018 with the goal of creating an affordable and environmentally sustainable option for coolers for fishermen. To date, they have operated in the Philippines, producing coolers made in large part of coconut husk, a common waste product. The coolers are intended as an alternative for expanded polystyrene (EPS) coolers with a usable life of just two weeks, or as alternatives to reusable polyurethane coolers that are often too expensive to be a feasible option for fishermen. Stanford team and Fortuna team worked together and conducted a formal life cycle assessment (Stanford CEE 226: Life Cycle Assessment for Complex Systems, advised by Dr. [Michael Lepech](https://profiles.stanford.edu/michael-lepech)) of Fortuna coolers. We determined that the Fortuna cooler life cycle is associated with drastically lower greenhouse gas emissions and is comparable to or has slightly higher emissions than EPS coolers in several impact categories. The capability of coconut husks to be degraded and converted into a biodegradable compost and fertilizer minimizes the energy requirement towards the end-of-life disposal; the ability to compost the Fortuna cooler provides additional benefit over EPS. ([Poster](https://github.com/J-i-n-p-u/Fortuna-Cools-Life-Cycle-Assessment/blob/main/Poster.pdf), [Report](https://github.com/J-i-n-p-u/Fortuna-Cools-Life-Cycle-Assessment/blob/main/Fortuna%20Cools%20Life%20Cycle%20Assessment%20Report.pdf))
    
6.  **[Battery Lifetime Prediction with Limited Cycle Data](https://github.com/J-i-n-p-u/Battery-Lifetime-Prediction-with-Limited-Cycle-Data#battery-lifetime-prediction-with-limited-cycle-data)** (Sept 2021 - Jan 2022, Stanford University)

    Key Words: Battery Lifetime Prediction, CNN, Bi-LSTM, Confidence Interval     [*(Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch)*]{style="color:green"}.

    ![](images/battery.png){align="right" margin="50" width="215"} Accurately predicting the remaining useful lifetime of batteries is critical for accelerating technological development and creating a paradigm shift in battery usage. Data-driven approaches,based on large datasets, provide a physical-model agnostic way to predict the health status of batteries with high accuracy. However, most datadriven methods on battery life prediction often rely on features extracted from a hundred cycles worth of data for a given cell, making it computationally inefficient and incompatible with on-board application.

    The course project (Stanford CS 329P [Practical Machine Learning](https://c.d2l.ai/stanford-cs329p/), advised by [Dr. Mu Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z_WrhK8AAAAJ&hl=en)) applied machine-learning models, including linear regression, random forest regression, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks to make predictions on cell life. Our best model achieve a 7.5% prediction error given the data of only 5 cycles. ([Report](https://github.com/J-i-n-p-u/Battery-Lifetime-Prediction-with-Limited-Cycle-Data/blob/main/Battery%20Lifetime%20Prediction%20with%20Limited%20Cycle%20Data.pdf), [Slides](https://github.com/J-i-n-p-u/Battery-Lifetime-Prediction-with-Limited-Cycle-Data/blob/main/Battery%20Lifetime%20Prediction.pdf), [Video](https://github.com/J-i-n-p-u/Battery-Lifetime-Prediction-with-Limited-Cycle-Data/blob/main/Battery%20Lifetime%20Prediction.mp4))

    This was a practical and valuable project to build an intelligent diagnosis, risk reasoning, and decision support system for municipal facilities. I independently developed a water consumption probabilistic prediction model based on the deep autoregressive (DeepAR) algorithm. The model has been integrated into the Shanghai Smart Intelligent Platform to predict daily water consumption and provide plumbing burst alarming services. ([Report](https://github.com/J-i-n-p-u/Long-term-probability-prediction-platform-of-urban-water-consumption/blob/main/Real_time_Water_Consumption_Prediction.pdf), [Slides](https://github.com/J-i-n-p-u/Long-term-probability-prediction-platform-of-urban-water-consumption/blob/main/Real-time%20Water%20Consumption%20Prediction%20Based%20on%20Deep%20Learning.pdf), [Codes](https://github.com/J-i-n-p-u/Long-term-probability-prediction-platform-of-urban-water-consumption))

    The project aims to predict TBM operation parameters based on its historical data, promoting safe and efficient tunneling construction of TBM. I independently developed TBM parameters and geological prediction model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network , and won the National Third Place in the data mining competition organized by the Chinese Society of Rock Mechanics and Engineering.

    The Near Infrared Spectroscopy Branch of the China Instrument Society holds the data modeling contest. The organizer provides a set of near-infrared spectral data from the actual application scenario. Different data preprocessing technologies (e.g. PCA, normalization) and machine learning models (AutoGluon) were tried for the unfrared spectrum classification problem.
