## About

I am a graduate student of the [Sustainable Design and Construction Program](https://cee.stanford.edu/academics-admission/graduate-degrees/ms-programs/sustainable-design-construction-sdc) Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University (2020 - 2022). My research interests lie in applying data-driven methods and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC) to help us create smart and sustainable infrastructures and living environments.

## Education Experience

2020 - 2022 M.S. in [Sustainable Design and Construction Program](https://cee.stanford.edu/academics-admission/graduate-degrees/ms-programs/sustainable-design-construction-sdc) in Civil and Environmental Engineering Department<br> Stanford University<br>

2019 - 2020 Exchange Student in [GeoSystems Engineering Program](https://ce.berkeley.edu/programs/geo) in Civil and Environmental Engineering Department<br> University of California, Berkeley (One Year)<br>

2019 B.E. in [Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://civileng.tongji.edu.cn/civilengen/main.htm)<br> Tongji University

## Conferences

-   Speaker in the 4th International Conference on Information Technology in Geo-Engineering (4ICITG) organized by Geotechnical Society of Singapore. Presentation: "***A Long-term Probabilistic Forecasting Approach of TBM Operating Parameters based on Deep Learning.***" (August 2022, online, <https://www.4iticg.org/4-august-2022>)

-   Speaker in the II International Geo-science Machine Learning Big Data Seminar. Presentation: "***Predicting TBM Performance using Machine Learning: is Surrounding Rock Information Important.***" (August 2019, Shanghai)

## Publications

1.  " A LSTM-based model for TBM performance prediction and the effect of rock mass grade on prediction accuracy " (China Civil Engineering Journal, first author, accepted)

2.  "PigSense: Vibration-based Activity and Health Monitoring System for Pigs" (ACM Journals, co-author, in review)

3.  "Improving adaptation to wildfire smoke and extreme heat in vulnerable communities: Evidence from a pilot study in the San Francisco Bay Area" (Environmental Research Letters, contributor, ready to submit)

## Research Projects

1.  [Computer Vision-based Pavement Distress Detection System](<https://github.com/J-i-n-p-u/Pavement-Crack-Detection-based-on-Computer-Vision#pavement-crack-detection-based-on-computer-vision>) (March 2022-Now)\
    Worked as a research assistant advised by Pooja Jain (V.P. Strategic Innovation in WSP) and [Dr. Martin Fischer] (<https://profiles.stanford.edu/martin-fischer>) (Professor at Stanford).

    This is a significant exploration of developing the practical workflow of a vision-based automatic pavement distress detection system and software kit, and I am also responsible for discovering the potential business value of the process.
